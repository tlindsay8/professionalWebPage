    <p>Hi! My name is Tyler Lindsay.  I am a software engineer asc at Lockheed Martin.  I graduated from Saint Anselm College in May of 2016.
    <br>  At Lockheed Martin I have been doing many projects and has had the opportunity to work with many different tools and devices. <br>
    My goal as an entry level employee is to truly get better at my craft and be as knowledgable in as many aspects of software engineering as possible.
    <br>  Outside of work I am on a journey to work on my front end development and it begins with this web page. </p>
